# bcm-test
Scripts that test the integrity of an embedded system prior to field replacement.

This repo contains scripts that check file integrity of an embedded computer called a "BCM".  Specifically, it is an embedded computer that is a field replacement of a failed BCM model out in the field.  

It should have already gone through provisioning prior to running this script.  This test should be run prior to deployment to the field.

Once executed, a resulting test report is auto-generated and auto-saved to the tester's desktop.
